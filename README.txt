I will be uploading some links here for resources and training on various tech, 
for prep for the next Challange.

* Online Coding Sites:
I recomend you install a coding IDE on your laptop to work, as it's more flexible than using
an online coding site. But if you have no options to install something local, then the
file "online_coding_sites.txt" has some options. 

* Virtual Environments / Labs
To setup a virtual environment on your laptop, like linux or something else. here
are some options for that. virtuilization.txt
